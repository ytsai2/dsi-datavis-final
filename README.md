Final Project Process Documentary
#### Yun-Ang Tsai / Dec 15th 2018
#### Background:
My thesis is working on trying to help potential dog owners with health and behavioral biases against shelter dogs receive the correct information needed to change their minds and increase their likelihood of adopting. From the interviews and researches I’ve done, I heard a lot people saying, ” People don’t educate themselves about rescue world.”
#### Purpose: 
To validate and show people now don’t pay enough attention to the stray dog problem and having biases on shelter dogs by comparing the data from the National Council on Pet Population Study and Policy (NCPPSP) with the answers I get from the Google Quiz sent out.
#### Process:
###### Step 1: Collecting data
I made a Google Quiz and got answers from mostly millennials in NYC (16 responses).

In a recent study conducted by the National Council on Pet Population Study and Policy (NCPPSP) and published in the July issue of the Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science (JAAWS), researchers went into 12 selected animal shelters in the United States for one year to find out why.

###### Step 2: Analyzing data

Here is the result I got, Top 3 reasons people think dogs are given up by their owners: 1.Problematic behaviors / Aggressive behaviors (56.3%) 2.Landlord not allowing pets (56.3%) 3.Cost of pet maintenance (56.3%)

But from NCPPSP’s study of 12 selected animal shelters shows that Top 10 reasons dogs are given up by their owners:	1. Moving (7%) 2. Landlord not allowing pet (6%) 3. Too many animals in household (4%) 4. Cost of pet maintenance (5%) 5. Owner having personal problems (4%) 6. Inadequate facilities (4%) 7. No homes available for litter mates (3%) 8. Having no time for pet (4%) 9. Pet illness(es) (4%) 10.Biting (3%) We can see that Pet illness and Biting are the last two reasons.

###### * NOTE: The percentages following the dog information in this section were not a part of the original press release and have been added. The figures come from an article by Dr. M. D. Salman, Dr. John G. New, Jr., et al., in the Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science, 1(3), 207- 226. The name of the article is, “Human and Animal Factors Related to the Relinquishment of Dogs and Cats in 12 Selected Animal Shelters in the United States.” The percentages do not add up to 100% because they represent only the top ten reasons given by owners for relinquishment of animals to shelters. 

###### Step 3: How to visualize the data
###### First idea - Comparing:
I looked up videos on Youtube and got inspired by an example showed by The Coding Train. Showing the top 3 reason bubbles under two categories, the biggest one will be the top 1 reason and so on. But this turned out not to be the best way to visualize the data. I need a more direct visualization.

###### Second idea - Simplify:
What’s the most important part of the data I got? What’s the purpose of this data visualization? I realize I should try to get people start to think about this issue in the most simplest and most obvious way. So I decided on just comparing the percentage of “health/behavioral problem”.

#### Challenges:
- Specific data around shelter dogs are really hard to find.

- Using online survey/quiz to collect data, the responses I could get was limited. Data integrity is difficult to achieve.

- "How does the trade-off between data fit with my purpose? What kind of visualization best present the data?" are still the questions need more practice.
